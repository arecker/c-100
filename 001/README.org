/I'm going on an adventure!/

OK, here we go.  This isn't so bad.  It's relieving to hear that C
uses /relatively few reserved words/.  For some reason I pictured a
lot of crazy perly regex looking monstrocities.  So far, everything
looks pretty recognizeable.  One of the exercises did have an =&=,
which I think might be called a "memory address" or something.

I found the difference between a "linker" and a "compiler"
interesting.  I guess gcc does both at the same time, so I would have
never thought there were separate steps for (1) turning the source
code into machine language and (2) compiling it into a binary from
other object files.

But so far so good.  I feel pretty good about the book I chose.  It
was just the right amount of history and absolutely not Microsoft or
Unix leaning.  I really wonder how productive I'll be after 100 days.

I had about ten minutes left at the end, so I just read the man page
for gcc.  By default, GCC will do preprocessing, assembly, compilation
proper, and linking.  There are flags you can pass in to stop it at
any of these points.  For example, I re-compiled my hello.c example
with the =-S= flag and, instead of an object file, it spit out this.

          .file   "hello.c"
          .text
          .section        .rodata
  .LC0:
          .string "Hello, World!"
          .text
          .globl  main
          .type   main, @function
  main:
  .LFB0:
          .cfi_startproc
          pushq   %rbp
          .cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
          .cfi_offset 6, -16
          movq    %rsp, %rbp
          .cfi_def_cfa_register 6
          leaq    .LC0(%rip), %rdi
          call    puts@PLT
          movl    $0, %eax
          popq    %rbp
          .cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
          ret
          .cfi_endproc

          .size   main, .-main

Is this private?  Is my private SSh key somewhere in that mess?  Did I
just heartbleed-meltdown myself?  Who knows.
