#+TITLE: Day 003

/All I see is blonde... brunette... readhead./

Today was kind of a dry lesson.  Just learned about variables,
constants, and how much memory each data type uses.  I used up the
extra free time to play around with benchmarks.  I wrote a program
that would count the number of characters in an ominously named
"bible.txt" that contains the entire Bible.  As expected, C out
performed python by a few extra deciseconds.  Milliseconds?
Cubitseconds?  That's probably it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  alex@lappy486:003$ time ./a.out
  There are 4452070 characters in the bible
  real    0m0.012s
  user    0m0.012s
  sys     0m0.001s
  alex@lappy486:003$ time python bible.py
  There are 4452068 characters in the bible

  real    0m0.052s
  user    0m0.044s
  sys     0m0.008s
#+END_EXAMPLE

On top of that, my C version of the program managed to find a few
extra characters.  What a wonderful and mysterious language.
