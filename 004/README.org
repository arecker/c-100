#+TITLE: Day 004

/Sometimes the road less traveled is [throws keys on table] better
left that way./  -- Jerry Seinfeld

Today's lesson, I was basically just water-boarded with operators.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, modulus, AND/OR... all while
dilligently learning each operators "precedence" over the others.  Not
going to lie, I think if you ever have to resort to this kind of
mechanism, you must be writing code incorrectly.  As long as variables
and parentheses are respected, there's no excuse to be an asshole.  If
anyone ever catches me writing something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  x = a < b || a < c && c < d;
#+END_SRC

They have permission to hit me.

On a positive note: I realized that a lot of features that come with
higher level languages are basically given to them for free by C.  I
assumed that there were at least /some/ smoke an mirrors behind
implementing something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC c
  x = y = z = 1 + 2  // x == y == z == 3
#+END_SRC

Nope.  That's been in C all this time.  Suddenly I'm angry at all the
times I've been coding in a language that /didn't/ let me assign more
than one variable at a time.
