Today's lesson was pretty fun.  Learning for and while loops opens up
more interesting practice examples.  I enjoyed the fake CLI menu
mechanic in [[file:menu.c][menu.c]].  Kind of reminiscent of Java 101.  We did the same
kind of imaginary CD collection exercise.

Part of the reason I was losing interesting is because I was just
copying the examples verbatim, then reading them over.  It's more fun
when I skim the program and just try to recreate it without the
specifics.  I think this new technique has given me second wind.
