/When this ends, at least I have a reason to live./  -- Brockhampton

Not much happened in this lesson.  Just looked a /little/ more deeply
into printf and scanf.  Also, C has a =puts= method.  What do you
know, I guess I was wrong to give ruby shit for calling their print
method =puts=.

"Trigraphs" are hilariously strange.  The second I used one, I got
yelled at by both emacs and GCC.  In fact, in order to compile the
example, I had to use a special "allow-trigraphs-really" flag.  I
don't really see the point of these.  I can't think of a time where
I'd want to print something in brackets, and for some reason want to
escape them with special ??symbols)?? in my program.  How strange.

With the extra time I had left, I attempted to write a program that
would print the time and date.  I got discouraged reading the
documentation for =time.h=.  Apparently I need to learn more structs
before I get into that.
