I'm slowly regaining my confidence in C, this time moving deliberately
more slowly.  Structs are very reasonable and fit in right where I'd
expect them to.  I accidentally discovered that functions can return
structs.  This alone has made me a little more efficient in cranking
out the code for these examples where I have to read in lists of
things and enter the property one at a time.
