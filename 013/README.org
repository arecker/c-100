Today I finished up the chapter about structs, which ended with some
interesting new syntax for structs and pointers, along with a brief
look at the seemingly meaningless "union" type.  Which is like a
struct, but you can only use one instance at a time.  Wonderful.  I'm
hoping that doesn't come up again.

It's starting to click that pointers are all about efficiency.  As
emphasized by the book, arrays suck because you have to declare how
much space you are going to use upfront.  BUT using a pointer to an
array is a way to leave that up to some other part of the program.  I
guess if you're going to allocate memory, do it in one place.

Also, it's never a mystery where the most expensive part of your
program is.  I have a half hour left, so I'm going to spend some time
reading up on the linux kernel and start familiarizing myself with the
source code.  I already know enough C syntax to follow along,  which
is exciting.
