I'm so fancy.  You already know.  I'm in the fast lane from L.A. to

Got kind of bored with the material of the book, which today was
infinite loops, breaks, and other things that resemble
Java/C#/JavaScript/Ruby/Python almost exactly.

Instead I wrote a pretty sweet program that would count the vowels in
bible.txt and display the results.  Even got fancy and used
preprocessor constants to configure if Y was a vowel.

Result set:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  struct result_set
  {
	  unsigned long other;
	  unsigned long a;
	  unsigned long e;
	  unsigned long i;
	  unsigned long o;
	  unsigned long u;
  #if Y_IS_VOWEL
	  unsigned long y;
  #endif
  };
#+END_SRC

Later on:

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  #if Y_IS_VOWEL
	  case 'y':
	  case 'Y':
		  results->y++;
		  return;
  #endif
	  default:
		  results->other++;
		  return;
	  }
#+END_SRC
