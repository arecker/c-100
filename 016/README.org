Read a little about input, output, and streams.  I was glad to finally
learn why =stdin= and =stdout= where just magically available
variables.  And also why some of the examples in the book fail me.  It
turns out these examples use =get()=, which according to StackOverflow
was officially removed from the ANSI standard a while ago.  Most
compilers allow this, but not without a good amount of complaining.
The safe alternative is to use =fgets=, the differences being (1) you
must specify the input stream and (2) the trailing newline will be
preserved.

I wonder if I could write a =gets= function?

Bah.  It's harder than it sounds.  That could be a fun challenge for
next time.
