Good stuff today.  Finished the chapter on I/O streams.  There's a lot
of symmetry those functions.  It was also good to read about what the
deal is between =gets= and =fgets= and figure out why gcc has been
yelling at me.

Contrary to what the book said, =fflush= is only intended to clear
output streams.  In order to flush =stdin=, I had to make my own
function.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  void flush(void)
  {
	  int c;
	  while((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF);
  }
#+END_SRC
