Oooh boy.  Things are getting pretty technical now.  Pointers to
pointers?  Arrays of pointers to pointers?  What's next, pointers to
arrays of pointers to pointers?  MAMA MIA.

I'm kind of tired tonight and sort of losing my mind.  I'm taking it
slow today.  I'm glad I cemented my understanding of arrays being a
pointer to the first element, because that's kind of important here.
