Wow.  Linked lists are really challenging.  And kind of fun.
Manipulating elements of a linked list suddenly puts the crazy =(*
thing)->prop= in a new light.  For example, if I wanted to print the
name of the third person in a linked list, I could simple write

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  head->next->next->name
#+END_SRC

It almost reads like English.  "Start at the head, take the next, take
the next, and give me the name."  Well, maybe not English, but like a
bad text message.

I'm really excited about messing with linked lists.  Easily, the most
fun part about C so far.
