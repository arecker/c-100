Well today was a little more productive.  I was not in the mood for
coding, since my phone bricked itself while I was ordering an Uber
outside the movie theater.  But with my wife's encouragement, I was
able to put the rage aside and work on C for an hour.

Today was writing to files.  This was a lot more simple than I thought
it would be.  As it turns out, =printf= is really just =fprintf= with
the output stream specified for me.  So all I have to do is use
=fopen= to create an output stream attached to a file and =printf= to
it.  Wonderful.
