Really digging this chapter on file output and input.  Some good
insight into the guts of how a computer writes to storage devices.
Also getting some good code out of it.  Having learned this, I feel
like I could get away with writing something productive.

Also, I found it funny that the =rand()= was returning the same
numbers on each run.  Luckily I came across this in a common lisp
program I was working on, and I remembered that I had to seed the
library with a value.  It is convenient to just use =time(NULL)= for
this purpose.
