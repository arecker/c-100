Ooh boy.  That was a fun one.  Love me some file operations.  Kind of
funny that C doesn't have a =copy= library function.  What a perfect
little challenge to play around with.  While I'm much happier with my
logic compared to the book, I'm getting a weird character printed at
the end of my copy.  Pride cometh before destruction, I guess.

Getting really excited to manipulate strings.  I just realized that I
don't know how to concatenate two words together.
