I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're smaller and not worth the mention
You’re tired of movin', your body’s achin'
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given.

Working on strings today.  I'm digging it, so far pretty straight
forward.  And now I don't even feel like I really need to think about
pointers and addresses.  It's getting more natural.
