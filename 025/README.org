If you're not familiar with the term /concatenation/, you might be
asking, "What is it?" and "Is it legal?"

OK, so the string stuff is pretty cool.  And fair.  The only trick
with concatenating strings, as expected, is that you need to have
enough space allocated ahead of time. I think I can wrap my head
around that.

Also, oh wow the string functions are pretty cool.  A lot more
advanced than I thought it would be.  Making an =index_of= function is
pretty trivial.  Here let's try it.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  #include <string.h>

  int index_of(const char *word, char letter)
  {
	  char *loc = strchr(word, letter);
	  if (loc == NULL)
		  return -1;
	  else
		  return word - loc;
  }
#+END_SRC

Good ol' pointer arithmetic doing most of the heavy lifting.
