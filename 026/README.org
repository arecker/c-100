I got home late last night, so doing a double header today.  Finished
up the C string functions chapter and discovered my new favorite one
liner.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  char buffer[80];
  puts("Enter a blank line to exit");
  while (strcmp(fgets(buffer, 80, stdin), "\n") != 0) {
	  // do things
  }
#+END_SRC

A lot of the books examples involve a prompt in a while loop that
should =break= at empty input.  This is a little bit cleaner I think.

Also, who the hell is responsible for these terrible names?  =strspn=?
=strcmp=?  =aoi= and =aof=?  Geeze Louise, it's like these people have
something against vowels or something.
