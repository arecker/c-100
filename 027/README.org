The errors in the code examples are really starting to drive me
crazy.  If you are going to explain something as strange as varying
numbers of function arguments, then holy hell get it right please.
Took a while to figure out what was going on.

The book's =average= function looked like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  float average(int num, ...);
#+END_SRC

And it was calling it like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  float result = average(0, 1, 2, 3, 4);
#+END_SRC

Sooooo, what does =int num= mean in this case?  What am i supposed to
do with that?  Like hell, that's what typo that an introductory text
book can't afford to make when explaining a new macro.  As it turns
out, the book intended to pass in the number of arguments before the
list of arguments, so the above example should have looked like this.

#+BEGIN_SRC C
  float result = average(
	  5, // number of arguments
	  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 // the actual numbers
  );
#+END_SRC

Eventually confirmed that by looking it up.  Still just perturbed at
yet another critical typo in the example solutions that sent me down a
rabbit trail.

SIGH.
