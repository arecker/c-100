Just realized I'm getting to the end of this book.  Today's chapter
was basically a "random functions" overview.  So I had better start
thinking of some more topics and projects to work on for the remaining
70 days of this challenge.

Really impressed that both =qsort= and =bsearch= are in stdlib, but
now how are pretentious tech companies supposed to screen candidates?
Surely they wouldn't accept =#include <stdlib.h>= as a solution!
