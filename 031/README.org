What makes us love? What makes us dream?  I found the light, now it's
all I see. So we ride that wave, when that tide comes in,
and that water deep, so be prepared to swim.

Well now that I'm done with my book, I'm on my own for the next
seventy days.  I'm off to a great start.  Within this hour, I was able
to install the libraries needed for ALSA development and compile some
test programs.  I also found a pretty complete tutorial for capturing
audio using the ALSA library.
