Really jazzed about how helpful the documentation is.  Though the ALSA
library was intimidating at first, I'm already getting used to how
some things work.  Today I wrote a function to print some information
about all the audio hardware on my laptop.

Luckily, C is pretty minimalist.  So while it looks like there are a
lot of datatypes and routines to learn when looking at a library,
everything is basically a struct, number, or function.
