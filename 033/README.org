Tonight I was a little distracted upon discovering that I'm still
dealing with the fallout of losing my phone.  I just... ugh.  OK I'm
not going to complain about that here.  This is a happy place for fun
times and great learning.

Kept working at some example code for reading in audio data.  It
appears that just reading in the raw data isn't enough to get
something like VLC to play it.  I think "encoding" is another layer.
Reading on, it seems the only way to play a sample that I record with
raw data is to write a program to play raw data.  More on that later I guess.
