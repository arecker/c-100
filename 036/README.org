OK.  Took a few days to clear my head, but the break may have been too
long.  Right now, C looks like Greek to me, but I've slowly started to
re assemble my audio program from the bottom up.

I managed to make /some/ progress.  I managed to re tool the example
to read from a file, rather than expect to get data from stdin - which
was hard to work with.  My program now reads in what it needs from
=/dev/urandom=, throwing spurious errors that happen as a result of me
not reading what =read()= actually was doing.
