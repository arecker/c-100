OK I'm officially having fun again.  I figured out how to split things
into different headers and source files and it's kind of fun.  Maybe I
went a little crazy with the portability, but I think it's fine that
I'm exploring.  Not sure what I'm trying to accomplish, but I feel
better introducting some structure.

I think my short term goal is to write a program that simply creates a
raw sound file for each guitar string and stops recording when you hit
enter.
