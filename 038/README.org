Well I'm totally stumped.  Every time I move values around, the
suddenly get zeroed out and I get floating point errors.  I tried
converting some of them to pointers, so I would know for sure that
there was only one copy, but I quickly got in over my head.

I think I need to look to the pros.  It's not even day 40 yet, I can
afford to do some more reading.  I'm going to find a good audio
project written in C and glean some tips for how to capture audio in
more than just one function.

Gosh, I miss day 1-20, when it was just me and a book of silly code
samples.  This stuff is hard.
